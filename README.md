### üõ† Tech Stack

At the beggining the app was developed in Ionic and Angular. In 2023, in order to make our app better, we migrate the app to Flutter, which allow us to have a much more modern and faster application while maintaining compatibility with a large number of operating systems and platforms.

To store and persist your data in the app we store a SQLite database directly in your device, thanks to an opensource package called [drift](https://github.com/simolus3/drift)
